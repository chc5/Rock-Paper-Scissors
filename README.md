# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## About
A Rock-Paper-Scissors multiplayer game that runs on a Java GUI application.

## What I have learned from this project
- Threading
- Java Sockets
- Peer-to-Peer Application
- Java GUI (AWT and Swing)
- Ports

## What I have accomplished
- Threading to create independent applications
- Communication between players using Java Sockets (e.g. Sending player's choice to the other app)
- Created a Peer-to-Peer Application where one of the two gets to be the server.
- Used port to send data between the two applications.
- Designed the application on AWT and Swing
